# 🖼️ Image Degradation Robustness Analysis

This project evaluates how image degradation techniques — **Gaussian Noise** and **JPEG Compression** — impact object or face detection performance.

## ⚙️ Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/Mshahnawaz1/Robustness-of-Yolo8n-Model.git
cd image-degradation-robustness
```

### 2. Create & Activate Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate it:

```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Run the Analysis

Run the main script to perform degradation experiments and generate results:

---

## 📈 Outputs

- **Visual Plot:** Comparison between original and degraded images
    
- **Metrics Plot:** Visualization of Recall and IoU decay under different degradation levels
    

---

---

## 📊 Insights

- **JPEG Compression:** Causes a _sharp decline_ in Recall due to blocking artifacts
    
- **Gaussian Noise:** Leads to a _gradual performance decay_
